          <p class="govuk-body">“Children who may struggle in their early learning are not ‘low ability’. We do not know what their potential might be. Every child can make progress with the right support.” (Development Matters, 2021). </p>

          <p class="govuk-body">Whilst it is essential that we acknowledge impacting factors such as difficult life experiences, an identified SEND or being from a disadvantaged background, these factors should not be seen as barriers to success but as an opportunity to offer tailored support. </p>
