            Positive impact
          </h2>

          <p class="govuk-body">Some children may have become more resilient regarding how to maintain communication with others, how to support those around them and how to manage uncertainty. Some children who have had the freedom to explore existing interests and knowledge, with limited or no expectation of outcome, may now have increased imagination.  </p>

          <p class="govuk-body">Some children who have had opportunity to express and discuss their feelings associated with the pandemic may now have emotional maturity.   </p>

          <p class="govuk-body">Some children who have spent more time with parents, carers and older siblings may have benefited from increased reinforcement of positive behaviours, rules and routines modelled to them, for example appropriate table manners.  </p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
            Negative impact
          </h2>

          <p class="govuk-body">Limited opportunities to interact with others, particularly those unfamiliar to children may have impacted on children’s confidence. Children may now have increased anxieties and concerns surrounding cleanliness, illness and safety resulting in difficulties engaging and concentrating. They may have experienced an increase in stressful situations such as financial difficulties.   </p>

          <p class="govuk-body">Staying at home means children may have lost opportunities to experience social etiquette, for example in restaurants. They may also have had limited opportunities to learn, rehearse and develop social skills such as turn taking and sharing.   </p>
