          <p class="govuk-body">Some children with access to technology, books and adult interaction may have benefitted from extended periods of online exploration and discussion. They may have had opportunities to get involved in family projects such as growing vegetables or learning about fixing household items.  </p>

            Negative impact
          </h2>

          <p class="govuk-body">Some children may have had limited opportunities to participate in day trips and travel and so less chance to experience new environments. They may have spent longer periods of time restricted to the 4 walls of their home with possible use of a garden.  </p>
