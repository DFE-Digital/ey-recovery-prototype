            <p>Research suggests that emotional development begins even before a baby is born. By the sixth month of pregnancy, babies’ hearing is nearly fully formed and they are becoming more aware of their environment in the womb.</p>

            <p>At birth, a baby will communicate and show their feelings by crying. At first, they will only smile as a reflex, but by 6 to 8 weeks smiling becomes a controlled response to show happiness and pleasure.</p>

            <p>To help with their emotional development, babies need lots of:</p>

            <ul>
            <li>eye contact</li>
            <li>positive facial expression</li>
            <li>reassurance</li>
            <li>cuddles</li>
            <li>comfort when crying</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In your setting, babies also need to hear lots of new language to help them to learn, develop and rehearse new vocabulary. Babies will benefit from plenty of talking, singing and general conversation to reinforce their understanding.</p>
